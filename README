This is the README for the Surreality Labs Project Vending Machine v1.0. See http://surrealitylabs.com/projects/project-vending-machine/ for details.

PREPARING THE CHUMBY
====================
In order to get the Chumby ready, you have to do a few things to it. This does not include wiring up the I2C port, which you also have to do.

Here's an outline, as I don't remember everything I did:

1. Open it and take out the MicroSD card.
2. Put the card in a reader, and plug it into a Linux or OS X machine.
3. dd if=/dev/<whatever the SD card is, whole device not partition> of=~/chumbybak.bin bs=4k
4. Eject the MicroSD card. Put a bigger (storage-wise) one in the reader.
5. dd if=~/chumbybak.bin of=/dev/<whatever the SD card is, whole device not partition> bs=4k
6. Eject the card, put it back in the Chumby.
7. Boot the Chumby to make sure it works. If it does, proceed.
8. Reboot the Chumby, pressing the screen until you get to the menu to Factory Restore.
9. Factory Restore to repartition the card.
10. Enable SSH on the Chumby.
11. SSH into the Chumby, run "gcc" to have it install the falconwing toolchain.

INSTALLING THE VENDING MACHINE SOFTWARE
=======================================
1. Copy the contents of the code directory for the Vending Machine software to /mnt/storage/vendingMachine/
2. SSH into the Chumby, cd into /mnt/storage/vendingMachine/i2c-progs/
3. Run "make all"
4. Create /mnt/storage/projects-src/
5. Copy your 8 ZIP files (or whatever) to that directory
6. Edit /mnt/storage/vendingMachine/vendingMachine.sh so that the PROJ entries reflect your files
7. Hook up the electronics and USB connector
8. Run /mnt/storage/vendingMachine/vendingMachine.sh - probably as root. Now you're vending!

You can run / debug the vending machine software over the serial console like we did, or you can probably also have it start on boot. We didn't.
